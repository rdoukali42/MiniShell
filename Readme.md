## Prerequisites

Before running MiniShell, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- macOS or Linux (the project is designed to work on both)
- Git
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MiniShell.git
```

2. Enter the MiniShell directory:

```bash
cd MiniShell
```

3. Compile the project:

```bash
make
```

## Usage

To start the MiniShell, simply run the following command:

```bash
./minishell
```

Now, you can enter commands just like in a regular shell environment.


Certainly! Here's the updated Commands section with the added commands (unset, export, env, cat):

## Commands

MiniShell supports various shell commands, as well as some built-in commands:

- `ls`: List files and directories.
- `cd`: Change the current directory.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `echo`: Display a message.
- `exit`: Exit the MiniShell.
- `help`: Display help information.
- `unset`: Unset or remove environment variables.
- `export`: Export environment variables to be inherited by child processes.
- `env`: Display the list of environment variables.
- `cat`: Concatenate and display the content of files.

You can also execute other shell commands available in your system, like you would in a regular shell.
